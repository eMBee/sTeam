The tests here use the pike scripts included to generate and run testsuites. 

mktestsuite
The mktestsuite script is a simple shell script that uses M4 to convert a testsuite input file into a testsuite that can be run by test_pike.pike. This script is found in $PIKE/include/pike.

Usage:

mktestsuite test.in > test

The input file is simply a series of test invocations; any code outside of a test invocation will be ignored and will not appear in the final testsuite file.


test_pike

The most important part of the regression testing infrastructure is test_pike, which is the pike script that performs the actual testing. Included in $PIKE/include/pike for Pike releases before 7.7, and as the builtin tool pike -x test_pike in releases 7.7 and higher, test_pike includes a large number of options for performing testing.

Usage:

  pike -x test_pike test

The first few cases are used to initialize the client and define global variables which are then used to execute tests.
We have written these initialization code as tests as there is no other way to execute simple pike code before running the tests.
